This repository will hold my work on my video game data analysis project.

I will work on video game data collected from https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales ( I will do this one after I learn  how to acquire data through webscrapping: https://www.vgchartz.com/). My end goal is to create a model that can predict North American sales based on user scores from the top three gaming news sites(IGN, Gamespot, Gamefaqs). If a game from the list does not contain a score from all three sites I will consider dropping the game.
