This repository will hold my work on my video game data analysis project.


*PROJECT DESCRIPTION WITH GOALS*
I will work on video game data collected from https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales ( I will do this one after I learn  how to acquire data through webscrapping: https://www.vgchartz.com/). My end goal is to create a model that can predict North American sales based on features discovered through exploratoration. The final result will be a Jupyter Notebook that contains my model to predict future sales of a game in North America.


*INITIAL HYPOTHESIS/QUESTION OF DATA*

Can you use a game's developer to predict its sales in North America?
